<h1>Axel Fay</h1>
<h2>
Hi! I'm Axel Fay, I live in Lincoln Massachusettes, and I'm an Undergraduate student at the Harvard Extension working towards a computer science major. 

I've had little experience with web design, but I took one class in web design a few years ago. I created the website <a href="http://www.axcots.com/home.php" target="_blank">Axcots.com</a>. Other than that, I don't really have much other web design experience.
<br/><br/>
I don't really have a favorite restaurant at the moment, but the latest place I ate at was <a href="https://www.chipotle.com/" target="_blank">Chipotle</a>
<br/><br/>
Here's a picture of a bowl I made at home.<br/>
It was my first ever serious and finished woodworking project, and I think it came out well!
