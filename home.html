Hi! I'm Axel Fay, I live in Lincoln Massachusettes, and I'm an Undergraduate student at the Harvard Extension working towards a computer science major. 

I've had little experience with web design, but I took one class in web design a few years ago. I created the website <a href="http://www.axcots.com/home.php">Axcots.com</a>. Other than that, I don't really have much other web design experience.
